Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)
====================================================================

I am an undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of Dhaka in Bangladesh. Currently, I’m a third-year student and I wish to do my research work in the fields related to Machine Learning in the future. But I have no source of income at this moment to carry the expenditure of this course. In fact, now I’m financially dependent on my parents and my monthly expenditure is around 90 US Dollar which I get from them. According to the socio-economic circumstances of a third-world country like Bangladesh, my parents cannot afford to help me financially to pay for this course. So, although I’m very enthusiastic to learn the concepts of Machine Learning, it is quite impossible for me to bear the expenses. Thus I’m badly in need of financial aid for this course and your kind consideration. Under this circumstances, I will be very much grateful to you if you grant me a financial aid for this course which will pave the way to achieve my future goals.

As I am pretty much enthusiastic to involve myself with the researches related to ML, I think I have to pursue higher studies to achieve my career goal. Completing this course will surely help me to continue in the fields of Machine Learning in the future and the certificate associated with this course will add a value to achieve my career goal. Therefore, I can define this course as a beginning of my learning in this area and hopefully will help me a lot to contribute in this field in the future.

At this moment, as a student, I have no source of income and so I am not in a position to consider a low-interest loan because I will have to pay the installments which will be very much difficult for me. But this low-interest loan scheme is a very good initiative in my opinion and will help a lot of interested individuals.
